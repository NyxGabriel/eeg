Analysis of electroencephalogram data from [physionet](https://physionet.org/about/database/) with a view to reproducing the classification results in [this paper](https://hal.science/hal-03477057/document?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR3UzR91MfBHO73CSZWK6QTDI6t0cpbEQHrmT9r8Vazzl9lGhewVMDXYVOY_aem_PxbOW954AyHy0jTub2Wlvw).


## Current reproduction (June 27th):

Same ranking, almost same top score, different shape of curves. Not 100% sure why, their methods were a little un-clear so I made assumptions about what they didn which can definitely be changed. Above is ours, below is theirs.
