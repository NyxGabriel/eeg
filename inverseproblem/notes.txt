To solve the inverse problem accurately I need:

    1. an accurate forward model
    2. an accurate inverse solver

Based on my notes in solver_accuracy.txt as well as the mne tutorial
source_localization_with_mne_dspm_sloreta_elorate.py I think the solvers
part of this is reasonable. Probably should be better, but it seems OK.
However I have lots of doubts regarding step 1.
