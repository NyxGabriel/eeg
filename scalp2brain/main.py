"""
Let's start with some skeleton code / pseudo-code to flesh out this
problem a little.

ef_brain would be a (n_simplices, ) shaped vector
ef_scalp would also be a (n_simplices, ) shaped vector
(we can construct our brain and scalp meshes to have the same number
of simplices).

Simplifications:
    1. it's reasonable to start with spheres of different radius (like a
       numerical 3-sphere model)
    2. let's just place a single dipole on the brain and compute the field,
       then we'll see about more realistic models.

Phsyiological weirdness:
    1. How do i treat the cerebro-spinal fluid?
    2. How do the E field "bounce off" the skull, seems like a classic
       wave at a boundary problem. Is that it?
    3. Is it realistic to treat the E field on the brain as a collection
       of dipoles?
