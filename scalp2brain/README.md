# Turning measurements on the scalp into measurements on the brain

Classifying motor imagery with [ECoG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocorticography) is [easy, achieving over 99.5% accuracy](https://sci-hub.se/10.1007/s42452-020-2023-x). So if we could transform our EEG data into ECoG data, we could crush the problem. This folder contains code related to this effort.
